![S.A.M Main Menu](SAM.gif)

S.A.M (Security Assistance Machine) is a stealth game made on Unreal Engine playable PC and on PS4 (we've done some builds on a dev kit).

You play as SAM, a robot tasked of saving the President, taken hostage from a terrorist group know as the *Unleashed*.

To do so, you will have to infiltrate the place where the President is being held.
You can kill as many enemies as you want while you stay in the shadows and keeping silent.
